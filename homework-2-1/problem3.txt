comparing the change in each method across a variety of n values, as n increases, 
the running time of constant method is have the shortest running time
the constant method is suppose to have zero growth rate (but because of noises and memory allocation delays, the runtime of constant method did change for the same n value and across n values)
the exponential method have the longest running time 
the running time growth rate is also fastest for exponential as n increases 
the running time of cubic method grew faster than constant and slower than exponential
